--- Metro Diary Editor ---
==========================

------ Introduction ------
Allows you to modify the collection status of diary notes in both Metro 2033 Redux and Metro Last Light Redux.

-- Achievement  Unlocks --
Setting all notes to collected will not trigger the achievement for collecting all notes to pop!
In order to get the achievement I recommend unlocking all but one note, preferably one in a easy 
to find location. Go in game and pick up the final note and this will trigger the achievement to
pop!
